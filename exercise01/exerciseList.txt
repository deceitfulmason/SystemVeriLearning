EXERCISES
Program, simulate, and test each of the following experiments using Quartus
II and the DE2 development board.
1. Using only instantiation, build a Majority module considering:
a) The module must have 4 input ports A, B, C, X, and one output Y.
b) When the majority of signals A, B, and C are true, Y must have the same value as
X, or zero otherwise.
c) Construct the truth table, sketch the logic circuit, name the internal signals, and
create the Majority module in SystemVerilog using only instantiation of primitive gates.
d) Instantiate Majority at the top, connecting to the switches and LEDs as necessary.
e) Compile, record, and test the circuit.


2. Build a hexadecimal decoder for 7 segments with an enable signal.
a) The module should be called d7s, have a 4-bit input X, a 1-bit input EN,
 and a 7-bit output Y.
b) When EN is active, the input number must be shown on the display. When
inactive, the display must turn off.
c) To test, connect via top the SW[3:0] switches as X, the SW[17] switch as EN,
and the HEX[0] display as Y.


3. Build a 16:4 encoder with gate.
a) The module must be called cod16_4, have a 16-bit input X, a 4-bit output
Y, and a 1-bit GATE output.
b) When one or more bits are active in X, the output Y must provide the most significant active bit number,
and GATE must be true.
c) When no bits are active in X, the value of Y does not matter, but GATE must be
false.
d) To test, connect SW[15:0] to X of the encoder, LEDR[3:0] to Y, and use the
display decoder from the previous exercise to show Y in hexadecimal.


4. Build a 4:16 demux.
a) The module should be called demux4_16, have a one-bit input X, a four-bit selector input
S, and a 16-bit output Y.
b) The value of input X should appear at the selected output Y, and the other outputs
should remain at zero.
c) Connect to the board and test.


5. Build a self-starting counter that implements the sequence 1-2-7-3-6-1.
a) The module should be called cnt_127361, have a CLK input with one bit, and an output
Y with 3 bits.
b) If it starts out of sequence, the counter should return to position 1.
c) To test, use KEY[0] as the clock, and the decoder from the first exercise to
display the number in hexadecimal.


6. Build a frequency divider from 50MHz to 1Hz using a counter.
a) The module should be called div50M, and have a CLK_IN input and a
CLK_OUT output, both with one bit.
b) The CLK_OUT output should remain active for only 1 out of every 50M CLK_IN cycles.
c) To test, use the board's 50MHz signal as the clock source, and toggle the state
of LEDR[0] whenever CLK_OUT is true.


7. Make an 8-bit counter that:
a) Shows the output in hexadecimal on two 7-segment displays, and in binary on
LEDR[7:0].
b) Increments by one when the user presses KEY[0] and releases it in less than
one second.
c) Returns to zero when the user holds KEY[0] for more than one second.
